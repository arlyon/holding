# holding

Holding is a command line toolkit and associated crates for DND.

It is intended to eventually be a host for campaign worlds handling dates, locations, events, calendars, and characters allowing an interactive history of things that have happened (or are going to happen) along with a number of generators to insert data into the world.

You will eventually be able to tag people and places in these events and be able to query the game world for things that have happened.

This will try and mould the DND game into a hybrid MUD, hopefully improving the DM's throughput and creating a more cohesive game world.
